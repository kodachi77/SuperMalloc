This test came from https://github.com/emeryberger/Malloc-Implementations/tree/master/allocators/ptmalloc/ptmalloc3

The tcmalloc web site
(http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html) claims great
performance on this benchmark compared to other allocators.  It looks
like supermalloc is substantially faster.
