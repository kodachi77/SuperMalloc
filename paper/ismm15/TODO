done: Remeasure ghostscript (now that we are madvise'ing better)
better stats for larson  (what is the 99th percentile?  What is the 95th percentile)

make a better argument on vyukov benchmark:  
  Hoard is fastest
 what happens if we run with a bigger footprint so that the 2MiB overheads don't run.
 Also run vyukov again, since now we call madvise more.

did we measure the value of precaching?
